I am a Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology with a strong interest in **software engineering, AI/ML, and robotics**. I have experience across a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, including Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, React, SQL, C, Dart, Node.js, Express.js, Next.js, and Flutter. My skills extend to various tools and technologies, such as AWS, MySQL, Docker, TensorFlow, Google Cloud, MongoDB, Firebase, Android Studio, Git, ROS2, and Jira. In my free time, I enjoy working on side projects and continuously learning new technologies.
